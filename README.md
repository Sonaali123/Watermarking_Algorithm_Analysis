#Social Media–Resilient Digital Image Watermarking: Comparative Analysis and Hybrid Algorithm Design Using SVD, DWT, DCT, NSCT, and QFT

This project focuses on developing a robust and imperceptible digital image watermarking system designed to withstand real-world social media transmission degradations.
It involves the implementation and evaluation of multiple baseline algorithms — SVD, DWT, DCT, NSCT, and QFT — followed by an extensive comparative analysis under various attacks such as compression, noise, cropping, rotation, and WhatsApp HD/Non-HD transmission.

Based on the performance metrics (PSNR, SSIM, NC, BER), the best-performing methods are combined to design a hybrid watermarking algorithm that enhances both imperceptibility and robustness.
The hybrid model is further validated against baseline techniques, demonstrating improved resistance to social media–specific degradations while maintaining high visual quality.
